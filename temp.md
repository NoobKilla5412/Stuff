# 3.5 Notes

A conjecture is a statement that may or may not be proven true.  
(It's a guess)

|     |          |
| --- | -------- |
| Def: An exterior $\angle$ of a $\triangle$ forms a linear pair with its interior $\angle$ (def ext $\angle$) | Def: Remote interior $\angle$'s are angles that do not form a lin pair with a specific ext $\angle$. |

## Ext $\angle$ Thm

The measure of an ext $\angle$ of a $\triangle$ is $=$ to the sum of its remote int $\angle$'s.

G: picture  
P: $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = m\angle 1$

|     |          |
| --- | -------- |
| 1. $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 + m\angle ACB = 180$ | 1. $\sum\triangle = 180$ |
| 2. $\angle ACB\wedge\angle 1$ form a lin pair | 2. def lin pair |
The rest is in notebook pg 18

## $2\angle$'s of 1 $\triangle\cong 2\angle$'s $2^{nd}\triangle\implies 3^{rd}\angle\cong$ 

G: $\angle A\cong\angle X$  
   $\angle B\cong\angle Y$  
P: $\angle C\cong\angle Z$
